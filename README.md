# my-fedora-postinstall

Gets various data ready from existing fedora install to quickly get things back up and running if needed.

**This was developed, tested, and ran with a Fedora 42 KDE system. I cannot guarantee it works perfectly for other Fedora spins/editions, but this should come pretty close.** Code is pretty DE-agnostic, anyhow.

## üìÑ `.gitignore`

- This is here simply because I'm choosing not to sync output files just to ensure repo is clean.

## üìÑ `generatePackageLists.sh`

- Ensures free and nonfree repos are added to the list.
- Runs `dnf repoquery --userinstalled --qf "%{name}\n"` to make a list of every installed package on the system. Does involve the default utils that comes with your desktop environment, KDE in my case.
- Runs `flatpak list --columns=application,origin` to generate a list of installed flatpaks with their repos to another text file. 
- Export the generated files off of your current system, whether that's on a NAS, Cloud Storage, Syncthing Array, or even a flash drive to have an easy reinstall experience on other computers!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does not work with manually installed .rpm files**. For this I'd recommend putting your RPM files in the `data` directory, and then copying your entire local copy of this repo as a .zip file to your target system.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Also does not work with third party repos, as of yet.**. In the future, I'll add steps for third party repos.


## üìÑ `generatePackageLists.sh`

- Installs packages and flatpaks.
- Walks you through just about every step.
- Completely automates installs, with the option of having a confirmation/review before actual installs happen.

## Future plans

- [ ] Add specialty install structions (optional, will be in a seperate file) to install third party stuff like Tailscale.
- [ ] Add specific configurations script for things like firewall settings.
